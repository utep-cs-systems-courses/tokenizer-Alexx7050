Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Intro:

This project is a simple ui in which the user can input a string repeatedly. The string is then tokenized by the space delimeter. The program would then print all tokens with each containing a word from the inputted string. The string will also be saved in a linked list history. The user also has the option to print the previous history as well as recalling a specific history. This required multiple files and implementations coming from a "tokenizer.h" and "history.h" header files. The tokenizer.h file to implement the tokenizer and the history.h file implements the linked list for the history.

# Run:

 - Find the 'src' directory
 - Type "make" (compiles program using a Makefile)
 - Type "./tokenize" (runs program)
